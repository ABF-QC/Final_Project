# Climate App Explorer for Downtown Montreal

</br>
Explore over a century of maximum/minimum temperature and precipitation data from downtown Montreal (McTavis/McGill). This project combines data analysis, modeling, and interactive visualization to understand historical climate patterns and explore future warming scenarios.

## Data

This project integrates a variety of datasets to analyze historical trends and to project our climate trends from our Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model in downtown Montreal.

</br></br>

**Historic Daily Climate Data**

The historic climate data for downtown Montreal at the weather station McTavish/McGill is available since 1871. Our main focus for the analysis and visualitsaion will be on maximum temperature, minimum temperature and precipitation. While we will focus solely on maximum and minimum temperature in our RNN model.

**Grenhouse Gases (Carbon dioxide and Methane)**

 Carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4), even though there are more greenhouse gases (GHG) contributing to climate change than these two, were chosen since they have a great impact on climate change.

The forecast of the GHG are based from the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs), which are climate change scenarios of projected socioeconomic global changes up to 2100 as defined in the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report on climate change in 2021. They are used to derive GHG emissions scenarios with different climate policies.

| Scenario  | Description                                                       |
|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **SSP4-34** | Intermediate GHG emissions with a desire to implement climate policies |
| **SSP2-45** | Low to intermediate GHG emissions with large social disparities  |
| **SSP4-60** | Intermediate to high GHG emissions with deep social inequalities |
| **SSP5-80** | Very high GHG emissions (worst case scenario)                    |

</br>

By using the CO2 and CH4 global mean concentration as an input features of my RNN model, I am hoping that it will be able to establish the connection between the GHG curves and the temperature. Thus, in its own way see the GHG impact on climate change.

**Montreal's Population**

Population density significantly impact the land surface of a city. The surface type consequently influence the surface albedo, its capacity to retain moisture, and so much more. When the population is dense enough and has changed the surface type from mainly vegetation to a dense building surface area, the urban heat island effect is created over the urban area. The Urban Heat Island Effect means that the urban area accumulate more heat than its surroundings rural areas and, consequently, the maximum temperature and minimum temperature will generally be warmer in the urban area than in the surroundings rural areas.

By using the Montreal's population as an input feature of my RNN model, I am hoping that it will be able to establish the connection between the population curve and the temperature. Thus, in its own way see the Urban Heat Island Effect.

**Included Variables**:
- `Date` â€“ daily timestamps (from 1910 onward)
- `MaxTemp (Â°C)` â€“ daily maximum temperature
- `COâ‚‚ (ppm)` â€“ atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations (monthly or yearly averages)
- `CHâ‚„ (ppb)` â€“ atmospheric methane concentrations
- `Population` â€“ projected and historical population values for Montreal or Quebec
- `Scenario` â€“ Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (e.g., SSP2-4.5)

**Format**: Combined CSV and JSON files (tabular format), organized by year or time-series.

## Data Pre-processing

Steps involved:
- Handle missing or inconsistent temperature values
- Convert date formats and extract time-based features (e.g., year, month, season)
- Aggregate data (daily â†’ annual/monthly means or extremes)
- Normalize/scale inputs for model training
- Merge historical data with projection scenarios
- Merge population, COâ‚‚, and CHâ‚„ concentration data for regression modeling or scenario analysis

Key tools: `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`

---

## Model

The modeling approach includes:
- **Forecasting Models**: Time-series regressors (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet, or RNN/LSTM for temporal dependencies)
- **Scenario Integration**: SSP pathway projections used to adjust forecasts based on policy or emission assumptions
- **Multivariate Extensions**: Incorporation of additional climate indicators (e.g., COâ‚‚, CHâ‚„) and population data

---

## Validation

Validation strategies:
- **Train/Test Split**: Typically 80/20 based on time (e.g., training: 1910â€“2000, testing: 2001â€“2023)
- **Metrics**: MSE
- **Cross-validation**: TimeSeriesSplit where appropriate

### Visualization
- Interactive line plots and scatter plots (Streamlit + Plotly)
- Forecast overlays with SSP scenarios (e.g., SSP2-4.5, SSP5-8.5)
